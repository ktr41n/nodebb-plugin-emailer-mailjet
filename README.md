# IMPORTANT

This is a fresh fork of pichalite's nodebb-plugin-emailer-mailjet updated to work on versions of nodebb >= 2.2.2 and to use the Mailjet v3.1 api.

It currently works, but is being tested. It is not available on npm and will have to be installed by cloning from github. You will also need node-mailjet >= 5.0.0.
